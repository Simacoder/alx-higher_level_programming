- Import

- Exceptions

- Class

- Private attribute

- Getter/Setter

- Class method

- Static method

- Inheritance

- Unittest

- Read/Write file

# Tasks

# 0. If it's not tested it doesn't work

mandatory

- All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.

# Base class

mandatory

- Write the first class Base:

 Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

# 2. First Rectangle

mandatory

- Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:

# 3. Validate attributes

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):

# 4. Area first

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.

# 5. Display #0

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.

# 6. __str__

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>

# 7. Display #1

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y

# 8. Update #0

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute:

# 9. Update #1

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes:

# 10. And now, the Square!

mandatory

- Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle:

# 11. Square size

mandatory

- Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size

# 12. Square update

mandatory

- Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns attributes:

# 13. Rectangle instance to dictionary representation

mandatory

- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle:

# 14. Square instance to dictionary representation

mandatory

- Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square:

# 15. Dictionary to JSON string

mandatory

- JSON is one of the standard formats for sharing data representation.

# 16. JSON string to file

mandatory

- Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs): that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file:

# 17. JSON string to dictionary

mandatory

-Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string): that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string

# 18. Dictionary to Instance

mandatory

- Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set:

# 19. File to instances

mandatory

- Update the class Base by adding the class method def load_from_file(cls): that returns a list of instances:
