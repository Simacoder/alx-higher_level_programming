# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Learning Objectives

- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:



# General

- Why Python programming is awesome

- What are lists and how to use them

- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists

- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them

- How to use lists as stacks and queues

- What are list comprehensions and how to use them

- What are tuples and how to use them

- When to use tuples versus lists

- What is a sequence

- What is tuple packing

- What is sequence unpacking

- What is the del statement and how to use it

# Requirements

## Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

- All your files should end with a new line

- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

- All your files must be executable

- The length of your files will be tested using wc

# Tasks

## 0. Print a list of integers

mandatory

- Write a function that prints all integers of a list.


# 1. Secure access to an element in a list

mandatory

- Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

# 2. Replace element

mandatory

- Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

# 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!

mandatory

- Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order


# 4. Replace in a copy

mandatory

- Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).


# 5. Can you C me now?

mandatory

- Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.


# 6. Lists of lists = Matrix

mandatory

- Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.


# 7. Tuples addition

mandatory

-  Write a function that adds 2 tuples


# 8. More returns!

mandatory

- Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.


# 9. Find the max

mandatory

- Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.


# 10. Only by 2

mandatory

- Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.



# 11. Delete at

mandatory

- Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.


# 12. Switch

mandatory

- Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b


# 13. Linked list palindrome

mandatory

## Technical interview preparation:



- You are not allowed to google anything

- Whiteboard first

- Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
